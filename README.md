# 👋 Hello World!

This GitHub page belongs to me, **Jesper**, and this is where I document everything and anything I work on. Feel free to have a look at my repositories!

In this README you will find information about my current skills and what I'm focusing on learning.

At the moment I'm studying **IT Security** with the dream of entering the **CyberSec** field. I live in Sweden 🇸🇪 and I'm passionate about all things IT. I run my own **Home-Lab** where I host everything from VMs and containers in **Proxmox** to storage and backup solutions. If I find something that's interesting, it will likely be running on my server by the next day.

My portfolio is currently under construction and will **hopefully be for the rest of my life**. Right now, I'm focusing on learning how to secure network infrastructure from the ground up (and anything else I have time for).
