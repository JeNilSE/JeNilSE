### Hello world and welcome to my Github page! 👋 My name is Jesper

In this README you will find information about what I currently have knowledge about or what I'm focusing on learning more about.

I am an **IT Security Student** based in Sweden, passionate about network security, automation, system hardening, servers, IoT, and virtualization.

My portfolio is currently under construction and will hopefully be for the rest of my life. Right now, I'm focusing on learning how to secure network infrastructure from the ground up (and anything else I have time for during my free time).
